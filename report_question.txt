A001: How can I check if a supplier with a specific name already exists in my supplier list, and if so, add that supplier to another list for later verification or manipulation?

#A002: How can I check if a supplier with the same CNPJ already exists before updating an existing supplier?

#A003: How would you ensure that changing a supplier (with a new CNPJ) only happens if the CNPJ is not duplicated in the system, and keeps the other suppliers unchanged?
