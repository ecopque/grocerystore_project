# Grocery Store Project

## Overview

Iâ€™m starting to work on a project that aims to simulate the operation of a grocery store, with features to manage product categories, inventory control, sales, suppliers, and much more!

The project includes the following main modules:
- Product Categories: Classification of items sold in the grocery store.
- Product Management: Registration of products with name, price, and category.
- Inventory Control: Available quantity of each product.
- Sales: Transaction record, with details about sold products, buyers, and sellers.
- Suppliers: Supplier registration, with information such as CNPJ (Brazilian tax ID) and telephone.
- People: Modeling of customers and employees, using an inheritance structure to facilitate data management.
